    <!-- Imagine you're making a decision in your daily life, like whether to go outside or stay indoors based on the weather. You use a simple thought process to decide:

    IF the weather is sunny:

    THEN you decide to go outside and enjoy the sunshine.
    ELSE (if it's not sunny):

    You check if it's raining:
    IF it's raining:
    THEN you decide to stay indoors to avoid getting wet.
    ELSE (if it's not raining):
    THEN you decide to go outside for a walk or do other outdoor activities.
    In this analogy:

    The "IF" part represents a condition you're checking, like whether the weather is sunny.
    The "ELSE" part represents an alternative action to take if the condition is not met.
    Inside the "ELSE" part, there can be additional conditions to check, like whether it's raining. -->

    <!-- Quick expample of if else statement -->
